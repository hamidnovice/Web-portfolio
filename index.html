            <h3>A broom is a cleaning tool consisting of usually stiff fibers </h3>
            <p> It is thus a variety of brush with a long handle. It is commonly used in combination with a dustpan.
            A distinction is made between a "hard broom" and a "soft broom" and a spectrum in between. Soft brooms are for sweeping walls of cobwebs and spiders, like a "feather duster". Hard brooms are for rougher tasks like sweeping dirt off sidewalks or concrete floors, or even smoothing and texturing wet concrete.</p>
